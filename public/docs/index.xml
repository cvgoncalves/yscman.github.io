      <description>This section assumes you have already installed the Congo theme.  The config files that ship with Congo contain all of the possible settings that the theme recognises. By default, many of these are commented out but you can simply uncomment them to activate or change a specific feature.
A few things you need to set for a new installation:
# config/_default/config.toml baseURL = &amp;#34;https://your_domain.com&amp;#34; languageCode = &amp;#34;en-AU&amp;#34; title = &amp;#34;My awesome website&amp;#34; [author] name = &amp;#34;Your name&amp;#34; image = &amp;#34;img/author.</description>

      <description>Congo is a highly customisable theme and uses some of the latest Hugo features to simplify how it is configured.
The theme ships with a default configuration that gets you up and running with a basic blog or static website.
 Configuration files bundled with the theme are provided in TOML format as this is the default Hugo syntax. Feel free to convert your config to YAML or JSON if you wish.</description>

      <description>Congo provides a fully flexible homepage layout. There are two main templates to choose from with additional settings to adjust the design. Alternatively, you can also provide your own template and have complete control over the homepage content.
The layout of the homepage is controlled by the homepage.layout setting in the params.toml configuration file. Additionally, all layouts have the option to include a listing of recent articles.
Page layout # The default layout is the page layout.</description>

      <description>In addition to the default Hugo front matter parameters, Congo adds a number of additional options to customise the presentation of individual articles. All the available theme parameters are listed below.
Front matter parameter default values are inherited from the theme&amp;rsquo;s base configuration, so you only need to specify these parameters in your front matter when you want to override the default.
   Name Type Default Description     externalUrl string Not set If this article is published on a third-party website, the URL to this article.</description>

      <description>In addition to all the default Hugo shortcodes, Congo adds a few extras for additional functionality.
Alert # alert outputs its contents as a stylised message box within your article. It&amp;rsquo;s useful for drawing attention to important information that you don&amp;rsquo;t want the reader to miss.
The input is written in Markdown so you can format it however you please.
Example:
{{&amp;lt; alert &amp;gt;}} **Warning!** This action is destructive! {{&amp;lt; /alert &amp;gt;}}    Warning!</description>

      <description>There are a few ways you can make style changes to Congo.
Colour schemes # Congo ships with a few colour schemes out of the box. To change the basic colour scheme, you can set the colorScheme theme parameter to one of the default configurations. Valid options are congo (the default), avocado, fire and ocean.
In addition to the default scheme, you can also create your own and restyle the entire website to your liking.</description>
