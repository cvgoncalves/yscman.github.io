      <description>In addition to all the default Hugo shortcodes, Congo adds a few extras for additional functionality.
Alert # alert outputs its contents as a stylised message box within your article. It&amp;rsquo;s useful for drawing attention to important information that you don&amp;rsquo;t want the reader to miss.
The input is written in Markdown so you can format it however you please.
Example:
{{&amp;lt; alert &amp;gt;}} **Warning!** This action is destructive! {{&amp;lt; /alert &amp;gt;}}    Warning!</description>
